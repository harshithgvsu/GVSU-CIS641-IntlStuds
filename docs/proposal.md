# Introduction

The objective of this project is to create an engaging and interactive web application that serves as a job board, allowing users to explore job opportunities in a modern, user-friendly way. The platform will provide a seamless experience for job seekers to browse, interact with, and apply for jobs by swiping through listings similar to a Tinder-style interface. In addition, users will be able to generate custom resumes using GPT-powered features, making job applications more personalized and efficient.

The application will require users to either register for a new account or log into an existing one. Upon logging in, users can explore job listings via swipeable cards that provide detailed job descriptions. If interested, they can save or apply for jobs directly through the platform. This job board aims to integrate animations and transitions to create an engaging experience that keeps users focused on the opportunities.

The platform will utilize modern technologies such as React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used for secure user authentication. Additionally, the platform will integrate GPT for resume generation, providing an AI-driven approach to crafting personalized resumes based on job descriptions.

# Anticipated Technologies

To build this project, the following technologies will be used:

- Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
-Â Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Resume Generation: Open API GPT
- Swipeable Cards: React-Spring
- Version Control: Git

# Method/Approach

- Environment Setup: Initialize the React project and set up the Node.js backend. Implement MongoDB for storing job listings and user information.
- UI/UX: Design and build an intuitive user interface. Incorporate swipeable job cards using React-Spring or Framer Motion.
- User Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication for secure user logins and registrations. Set up forms for login/register in React.
- Job Listings: Develop a system where employers can upload and manage job postings. Display these dynamically in the swipeable job card format for users.
- Resume Generation: Integrate GPT to allow users to generate custom resumes based on specific job descriptions.
- Swipeable Job Cards: Implement smooth transitions for job swiping, using animation libraries to enhance the user experience.
- Testing and Deployment: Thoroughly test the app for performance, security, and usability before deploying it.

# Estimated Timeline

- Week 1-2: Research and requirement gathering. Define technical feasibility and explore UI/UX design. 
- Week 3: Set up the development environment and implement basic authentication using JWT with user registration and login.
- Week 4: Build out the swipeable job card feature and integrate it with job listings in the MongoDB database.
- Week 5: Add the GPT-powered resume generation feature, allowing users to create custom resumes.
- Week 6: Test user interactions and swipe functionality. Add final animations and polish the UI.
- Week 7: Conduct thorough testing, resolve bugs, and prepare the project for deployment.
- Week 8: Final adjustments, project documentation, and deployment.

# Anticipated Problems

- User Management: Managing multiple user roles (job seekers and employers) securely and efficiently.
- Swipeable Cards Performance: Ensuring smooth animations and transitions in swipeable cards without performance issues.
- Resume Generation: Integrating GPT with high accuracy while keeping the generation time minimal for a smooth user experience.
- Authentication & Security: Safely handling JWT tokens and user data, particularly passwords and personal information.
- Job Data Storage: Optimizing the MongoDB database to store large volumes of job listings and user data without delays in retrieval.
